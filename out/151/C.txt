各問題について, 「その問題で既に AC が出たか」及び「その問題で WA が出た回数」を記録しな
がら, 提出を順に調べて処理します.

WA が出たときは, その問題の WA 回数を 1 増加させます
For each problem, record ”whether AC has already appeared for the problem or not” and ”the
number of WAs appeared so far for the problem,” while processing the submissions in order.
If the verdict was WA, then increase the number of WAs for the problem by one.
If the verdict was AC, then if it is not the ﬁrst AC for the problem, then do nothing. If it was the
ﬁrst one, the number of Takahashi’s correct answers increases by one, and the penalties increases
by ”the number of WAs appeared so far for the problem.”
The process above is O (N + M ) and fast enough.
